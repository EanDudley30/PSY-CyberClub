	You are a newly hired Cybersecurity consultant for the City Government. We believe that we have recently been attacked.
	We have cleaned up after this attack... for the most part. There are some suspicious things happening sometimes but all of our systems are functional. 
	We need you to harden 4 machines for us including a Linux LAMP Stack (serving a webpage), a Windows Server for file sharing, and 2 Windows Workstations.

	Our systems are currently airgapped to the internet however they still serve our LAN. Therefore, you will not need to install updates.
	However, we ask that you configure our update policy so that updates are isntalled automatically in the future. 
	The default firewall is the only company approved Firewall for use on Windows machines at this time.  Only authorized users and administrators are allowed to use these machines. Company policy mandates that senestive data, media files, and hack tools are not stored on this machine and especially not in user storage space. Only the authorized critical services should be running on this machine. 

	Before you are finished we just a couple of DFIR questions on the Desktop; please do your best to get an answer to these but also make sure our systems get hardened before the next attack.
